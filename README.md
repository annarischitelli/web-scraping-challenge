# web-scraping-challenge

In this assignment, I tried to build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. 

I scraped and pulled the following data:
- NASA Mars News
- JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image
- Mars Facts Table
- Mars Hemispheres Images

Next, I tried to use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.

Lastly, I tried to create a template HTML file called index.html that will take the mars data dictionary and display all of the data in the appropriate HTML elements.
